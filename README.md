#### Resume
The JumpModule is a 3D project.
Functions are already assigned at the Start, 
We must not forget to rename objects as in the code.
The player can make a maximum number of jumps we choose. 
We have two boolean,
the one on the field that identifies whether the player is on the field or not, 
and the jump that signals whether itâ€™s in the air or not.
